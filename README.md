Women's Safety Application that provides women with a reliable way to place an emergency SMS message comprising this location to the registered contacts.

ABSTRACT

The safety of women is a concern of increasing urgency in India and other countries. The primary issue in handling these cases by the police lies in constraints preventing them from responding quickly to calls of distress. These constraints include not knowing the location of the crime, and not knowing the crime is occurring at all: at the victim's end, reaching the police assuredly and discreetly is a challenge. To aid in the removal of these constraints, this project introduces an application called Women's Safety Application that provides women with a reliable way to place an emergency SMS message comprising this location to the registered contacts. The user can easily and discreetly trigger the message function by pressing any key (except 0 and 9). A message containing the user's geographical location is immediately sent to emergency contacts. In the new application, we provide a user-friendly connection where the user can send notification information in a simpler and more intelligent way. This project describes the application, its development, and its technical implementation.
